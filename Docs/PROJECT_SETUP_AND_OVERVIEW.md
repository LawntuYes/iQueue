# PROJECT SETUP AND OVERVIEW

## ABOUT THIS FILE
THIS DOCUMENTATION FILE EXPLAINS THE PROJECT STRUCTURE, IMPORTANT COMPONENTS, AND STEPS TO SET UP AND RUN THE IQUEUE APPLICATION.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
IQUEUE IS A QUEUE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM COMPRISED OF A NODE.JS/EXPRESS BACKEND AND A REACT/VITE FRONTEND. IT USES MONGODB FOR DATA PERSISTENCE.

## PREREQUISITES
BEFORE YOU START, ENSURE YOU HAVE THE FOLLOWING INSTALLED:
- NODE.JS (LATEST STABLE VERSION RECOMMENDED)
- MONGODB (LOCAL INSTANCE OR ATLAS CONNECTION STRING)

## PROJECT STRUCTURE
- **BACKEND/**: CONTAINS THE SERVER-SIDE CODE (EXPRESS API, DATABASE CONNECTION, MODELS).
- **FRONTEND/**: CONTAINS THE CLIENT-SIDE CODE (REACT, VITE).
- **DOCS/**: PROJECT DOCUMENTATION.

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. CLONE THE REPOSITORY
ENSURE YOU HAVE THE CODEBASE LOCALLY.

### 2. BACKEND SETUP
NAVIGATE TO THE BACKEND DIRECTORY AND INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:
```bash
cd Backend
npm install
```

#### ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
CREATE A `.env` FILE IN THE `Backend` DIRECTORY WITH THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES:

```env
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/iqueue_db  # OR YOUR MONGODB ATLAS CONNECTION STRING
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here
NODE_ENV=development
```

**IMPORTANT**: 
- `DATABASE_URL` IS REQUIRED FOR MONGODB CONNECTION.
- `JWT_SECRET` IS USED FOR SIGNING TOKENS.

#### RUNNING THE BACKEND
TO START THE BACKEND SERVER IN DEVELOPMENT MODE (WITH WATCH):
```bash
npm start
```
THE SERVER WILL RUN ON `http://localhost:3000` (OR THE PORT YOU SPECIFIED).
API ENDPOINTS ARE AVAILABLE AT `/api`.

### 3. FRONTEND SETUP
OPEN A NEW TERMINAL, NAVIGATE TO THE FRONTEND DIRECTORY AND INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
```

#### RUNNING THE FRONTEND
TO START THE FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT SERVER:
```bash
npm run dev
```
THE APPLICATION WILL TYPICALLY RUN ON `http://localhost:5173`.

## IMPORTANT COMMANDS

### BACKEND
- `npm start`: RUNS THE SERVER WITH HOT RELOAD (USING --WATCH).

### FRONTEND
- `npm run dev`: STARTS THE DEVELOPMENT SERVER.
- `npm run build`: BUILDS THE APP FOR PRODUCTION.
- `npm run lint`: RUNS ESLINT CHECKS.

## ARCHITECTURE HIGHLIGHTS
- **DATABASE**: MONGODB CONFIGURED WITH MONGOOSE.
- **AUTHENTICATION**: JWT-BASED AUTHENTICATION WITH COOKIES.
- **VALIDATION**: ZOD IS USED FOR INPUT VALIDATION.

If you encounter any issues, check the console logs in both Backend and Frontend terminals.
